# CronParser

A library and CLI tool for parsing cron expressions, written in C#.

The .NET 8 SDK is required to build and run the solution.

To run the tests from the command line, run `dotnet test` anywhere in the solution.

To run the CLI tool, run `dotnet run "<cron expression>"` from the `CronParser` directory, or use `dotnet build --output <output path>` to build an executable.
